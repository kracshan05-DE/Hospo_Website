// Static export: `next build` writes plain HTML/CSS/JS to `out/`, which
// Netlify serves from its CDN. There is no server, database or API route at
// runtime, so there is nothing to keep alive, patch at runtime, or attack.
//
// Consequences of `output: 'export'` worth knowing:
// - No middleware, server actions, API routes or ISR. Products are fetched
//   from Sanity at build time; publishing in the Studio triggers a rebuild.
// - `headers()` here is not supported. Response headers live in netlify.toml.
//   The Content-Security-Policy is set per layout via <meta> (see lib/csp.ts).
// - next/image cannot optimise at request time. Product photos are resized
//   by Sanity's image CDN instead (see sanityImageUrl in lib/sanity.ts).
